				Where to begin? Sheesh. So much has happened in the past ten years of travel that I neglected to document with words. Pictures, yes, I have a ton. some would argue still not enough. With my newfound path in web development, I can finally build my own blog site to share the treasures of Central America (and various other continents) I’ve discovered over the years. From budget travel to full blown vacations, I’ve done it all. I’ve studied in multiple Countries, bartended, traveled, explored and worked in journalism. I’ve found homes in places I would have never knew existed and found unconditional love and acceptance in countries I barely spoke the language. The world is my home and the people I meet along the way make it so. From adventures to epiphanies to sketchy situations, I like to think I’ve seen a lot abroad. But even more, I realize there is so much more to see! These next few posts will be summaries of past travels- places to see and things to do, mainly on a budget.  I will then continue to add my future travel experiences, tips and tricks.

				A little about me! I am Katie.. Kathryn Patricia.. ktllama… sunflower skies photography. My first time leaving the country I was 18.. my parents took my sister and I to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico for my high school graduation.  Unlimited food, drinks and fun… room service that would bring us lighters if needed.  Of course, though, this was all sugar-coated travel. I would say my first real experience being immersed in another culture was my first study abroad trip to costa rice (that will be a whole other post). From there I studied abroad in Belize, Spain and Eastern Europe. After completing my master’s in education and working at a school in DC, with more friends from other countries than the US, I realized living in the states full time was not for me. After a year in education, I began my adventure! I gave away/sold almost everything I owned and began my trip backpacking for months from Peru to Colombia through South America.  Right from there I moved to my new home, Guatemala.  In that country, my favorite country in the world, I lived for multiple years working in education, community development, almost every bar in Antigua and finally found my way into coffee journalism. During my time in Guatemala, in my spare time, I traveled all Central America. I became somewhat of an expert in traversing the chaotic, amazing and sometimes scary terrain of this part of the world. I stumbled upon places not found on the internet and had experiences (with lessons learned) that would make for great campfire stories.  I would love for this blog to find people who share the same love of travel and adventure.  Hopefully some of my posts will guide your trip with tips on how to get around, where to stay, what to eat and what to do (or at least what I did anyway)! And in the end, you can create and experience your own life changing journey!

				So far, my expertise is in Central America, mainly Guatemala.  However, I intend to continue traveling and explore new parts of the world as well! Stay tuned.
