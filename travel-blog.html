					Where to begin? Sheesh so much has happened in the past 10 years that I neglected to document with words. Pictures, yes, I have a ton.. some would argue still not enough. Maybe it’s because I am learning web development and can finally build my own blog site, or maybe I finally feel the need to share the treasures I’ve discovered over the years. From budget travel to full blown vacations I’ve done it all . I’ve studied in multiple Countries, bartended, traveled, explored and worked journalism. I’ve found homes in places I would have never knew existed and found unconditional love and acceptance in countries I barely knew the language. The world is my home and the people I met along the way make it so. From adventures to sketchy situations I like to think I’ve seen a lot. But even more, I realize there is so much more to see! These next few posts will be about past travels and then I hope to continue to add my future travel experiences, tips and tricks.

					A little about me! I am Katie.. Kathryn Patricia.. ktllama… sunflower skies. My first time leaving the country was when I was 18.. my parents took my sister and I to an all inclusive resort.. upside down liquor bottles with nozzles and room service that would bring us lighters if needed. But I would say my first real experience being immersed in another culture was my first study abroad trip to costa rice (that will be a whole other post). From there I studied abroad in Belize, Spain and Eastern Europe. After completing my masters in education and working at a school in DC with more friends from other countries than the US I realized living here in the states full time was not for me. After a year in education I began my adventure backpacking for months through South America and then moved to Guatemala.  There, in my favorite country in the world, I lived for multiple years where I worked in education, community development, almost every bar in Antigua and finally found my way into in coffee journalism. During my stay in Guatemala I was lucky to travel all of Central America in my spare time. Needless to say I became somewhat of an expert in traversing the chaotic, amazing and sometimes scary terrain of Central America. I would love for this blog to find people who share the same love of adventure and make their trip a bit easier with tips about how to get around, where to stay, what to eat and what to do!
					<Br><br>
					So far my expertise is in Central America, mainly Guatemala.  However, I intend to continue traveling and explore new parts of the world as well! Stay tuned.
