					Hello world! This right here is the beginning of my blogging endeavor.   I aim to use this space to document useful tools, tips and lessons I learn along the way to becoming a full-stack web developer.  The hope is to use this as a more elegantly worded notebook that maybe, just maybe, can help other novice web developers throughout their own journey.
					<br><br>
					A little about me.  I have always been spirited and outgoing, traveling on a whim, flying wherever the wind blew me.  Social and eccentric, always searching for my nook in the world, I am grateful to have seen many places and to have met such wonderful people along the way.  Upon entering university in 2010 I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.  After traveling to Costa Rica that same year to studying cross-cultural communication I knew I wanted to work on a global level. As undergrad progressed, I gravitated towards the humanities, international development and sustainable development.  That was all fine and dandy; double majored, graduated Magna Cum Laude, and was off to DC to save the world! However, it was not that easy (womp wooomp)... competition was fierce, jobs were scarce and networking was hard.  After a year of bartending, I decided to try my hand at education. I told myself  “I can teach anywhere and everywhere and always have the option to save the world one day down the line”. Upon finishing my master’s in education, I taught for a year at a Montessori Charter School in DC.  Forever appreciative for the experiences and things I learned at this job, it turned out, this still was not what I was looking for.  So, I packed (and sold) everything I owned and headed south to the beloved and beautiful country, Guatemala.  There I wore many hats as an educator, bartender, community developer, and even tried my hand at journalism in the insane and amazing Central American coffee world.  All of these roles shaped my life, left me with wonderful friends, experiences, and worldly knowledge- but still no idea of what I wanted to do with my career.  Should I become a fulltime travel blogger selling hula hoops? probably not!
					<br><br>
					After moving back to the states during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world slowly began to open again, I found myself wondering... what now?  Living abroad wasn’t an option and teaching wasn’t a match- I had an unquenchable need to continue learning and was in desperate need of a more flexible schedule (I also moved to South Carolina and the salary they pay teachers is disgraceful).  After thinking long and hard: almost 30, don’t want to go back to school, flexible schedule needed... what type of career does one go into?  I started taking IT classes on Coursera.  Not just in web dev, but IT support, python, routing, cyber security, you name it. Finally! at last! hallelujah! Something stuck.  I was tasked with a very simple project of creating a portfolio using HTML and CSS.  It was not great, subpar at best, but something clicked.  I loved the moving pieces, the research, the life-long-learnesk mindset that went in to creating this portfolio.  So, I decided then and there, I'm not sure where this will take me, I'm not sure what I will need to learn, I don't even know what front-end means, but I am sure this is what I want to do. This is what motivates me and, as cheesy as it sounds, lights a fire in my heart.
					<br><br>
					Aside from web development satisfying my love of variety, creativity, design, logic, and math,  I figured, eventually, I could also continue to work on a global level and hopefully in a field of development that can help make the world a better place.
					<br><br>
					From there I thought it would be easy, I just had to learn!  Take a bunch of classes, find a job willing to teach me and learn! I was definitely right about the learning aspect; I just didn't realize HOW MUCH there was to learn.   I found an internship building the local Habitat for Humanity’s website using HTML, CSS with the guided structure of square space.  I loved it, working unpaid, I still looked forward to my days in the office and found myself noodling over design problems long after I left.  After I finished the website I thought, okay.. what now? I have the internship; I have the basic HTML and CSS... so... Javascript?  Easier said than done this was.  At this point I really entered the labyrinth of endless frameworks, tools, languages, libraries and jargon that comprises the world of web development.  At first this intimidated me, but then it excited me, as this was perfect! I could finally be the life-learner I had always wanted to be! But this time, making a living off my education instead of paying an arm and a leg for it.  After shooting my shot at Javascript and talking to numerous other web developers, I enrolled in a full-stack boot-camp focuses in Bootstrap, React, React Native, Node.js, can Mongo DB. 
					<br><br>
					Today I finished the bootstrap portion of the boot-camp, all smooth sailing with a super cool idea for an app! Whats to follow both terrifies and motivates me! React! and then to the back end! I am ready and excited and loving every second of this process. I figure as I watch endless hours of you tube tutorials and read hundreds of pages of documentation the best way to remember this overload of information is to summarize what I am learning right here in this blog.  I will post summaries of what I learn with links to the tutorials that helped me. I will share my tips and tricks in the form of note-to-self posts.  This will be my digital notebook that, hopefully, can help other aspiring web devs find answers along their journey.  So, wish me luck, good luck to you too and happy coding!
